Imported into Fusion 360. Realized they import in CM so scaled down model by 1/10. Did planar cuts with fill minimal. Printed these out.

This link showed me that importing is in CM by default: https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/why-are-fusion-dimensions-10x-greater-on-imported-stl-files/td-p/5439722     

And here is a helpful resource on cutting 3d models in fusion 360 to print: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFQ4-1GH0wg     

I included the STL files for the split body in the repo.

Printed slowly over a couple weeks.

Used M2x20mm screw for middle foot and body,  2x M4x12mm and M4 Nutts for fixateur to alexa part, 2x M3x12mm for left leg to left foot and right leg to right foot.
